"""Tracing must be invisible unless somebody asked for it, and must never take the agent down.

Two guarantees, both of which matter more than the traces themselves:

Off by default. The submitted demo runs with no collector reachable. If enabling telemetry were the
default, every start would spend its timeout trying to reach one, which is a slow demo and a
confusing log for no benefit.

Never raises. A monitoring backend is the least important dependency this service has. If the
exporter cannot start, the correct behaviour is to say so and run untraced, not to refuse to serve
a chief or a provider who needs an answer now.
