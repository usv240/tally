"""Minted keys, and every way one can fail.

The key is signed rather than stored, so these are the only checks standing between a forged key
and a 200. The sandbox is read-only over synthetic data, so nothing here is protecting much, and
that is exactly why the code has to be right: a security mechanism that is only decorative should
at least be correct decoration, or it teaches the wrong thing to anyone reading it.
