"""House style, applied to text a model wrote.

`tools/check_copy.py` holds every file in this repository to one rule: no emoji, no em or en dashes.
It runs in CI on every push, and it had never once looked at the text that actually reaches Rosa.

Most of what she reads is written at request time by a model. A question about what the pale liquid
in the oatmeal bowl is, the smallest fix for a lunch, a note home to a parent. On the deployed
service two of those questions came back with em dashes in them, which means the rule this
repository enforces on itself was not true of the product.

So model output passes through here on its way to a screen. Punctuation only: nothing is truncated,
reworded or dropped, because the point is a house style and not a filter.

The characters are built with `chr()` rather than written out. Putting them in a literal would make
ruff flag ambiguous Unicode, and would make `check_copy.py` fail the one file whose whole job is to
stop those characters reaching a person.
