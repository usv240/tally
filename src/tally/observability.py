"""OpenTelemetry traces from the agent graph, so the trace viewer is not the only witness.

`runtime.py` emits an event for every step an agent takes, and the web app renders those into a
readable story. That is the right thing for a provider looking back at a day, and it has a real
limit: it is our own format, read by our own viewer, and it stops at the edge of this process. If a
claim comes out wrong on the deployed service on a Tuesday, nobody is watching that viewer.

Strands already instruments itself with OpenTelemetry. Every agent invocation, every model call and
every tool call becomes a span with timings and token counts, including the path taken through the
plate and roll graph, which is exactly the part the hand-rolled events describe worst. Turning it on
is one call. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability and CloudWatch both ingest OTLP directly, so the
same spans land somewhere durable without any code here knowing which backend received them.

This is off unless an endpoint is configured, deliberately. A demo should not depend on a collector
being reachable, and an exporter that cannot connect is a slow startup and a confusing log rather
than a useful trace. Nothing below can raise into the request path.
