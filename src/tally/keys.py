"""Mint and check sandbox API keys, without storing any.

The developers page used to print one shared key and ask people to trust that the header did
something. That is a worse demonstration than it looks: a reader cannot tell whether the key is
checked at all, and the one thing they might want to do, call the thing themselves, needed them to
copy a constant out of a paragraph.

So the page mints a key instead. It is signed rather than stored: the expiry is put through HMAC
with a server secret, and checking it is recomputing that signature. No database, no cleanup, and a
key that was not issued here cannot be forged without the secret.

**This is a sandbox and the page says so.** Anyone can mint a key, so a key proves nothing about who
is calling. It exists so the authentication path is real and visible rather than described, and so
the shape matches a deployment where each sponsoring organisation holds its own key. The data behind it is
synthetic and the whole demo resets.

Keys look like `ta_<expiry>_<signature>` and last a day.
